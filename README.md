📊 Business Sales Dashboard – Olist E-commerce Analysis
📁 Project Overview

I built a complete Business Sales Dashboard using the Olist Brazilian E-commerce Dataset, which contains multiple relational tables such as orders, order items, customers, products, sellers, and payments.
This project demonstrates real-world business analytics using Power BI.

🔧 What I Did
✔ Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)
Handled missing values
Converted data types
Extracted year, month, and day
Merged tables where required
Removed duplicates

✔ Data Modeling
Built a Star Schema
Fact Table → Order Items
Dimension Tables → Customers, Products, Sellers, Orders, Payments
Created relationships using keys like order_id, product_id, seller_id

✔ DAX Measures
I created KPIs such as:
Total Revenue
Total Orders
Total Customers
Average Order Value (AOV)

Revenue by Category
Year-over-Year Growth
